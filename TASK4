Basically I like OpenCV and wanted to explore Machine Learning,ROS,Path Planning as I read about this stuffs during the preparation for SnT Teams Selection so I wanted to continue learning more about these domains.And it would be really fascinating to learn how we apply these domains practically during the project of Mars Rover,also I came to knew about ISRO'S Mars Rover Challenge so I just wanted to try my hands on this project :)).
