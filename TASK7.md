Basically We need to follow the Grassfire Algorithm.
# PseudoCode
Conceptually, weâ€™re going to begin by marking the destination node with a distance value of 0. Then, we find all of the nodes that are 1 step away from the destination and mark them with a 1. Then, for all the nodes that are 2 steps away, mark them with a 2. All of the nodes that are 3 steps away, mark with a 3, etc, etc, etc, until we encounter the start node. For every cell in the grid, the distance value that it gets marked with indicates the minimum number of steps that it would take to go from that point to the destination node. Note how the numbers radiate outward from the destination node, like a fire, hence the name. Practically speaking, one way that you would actually run this procedure, is by maintaining a list of nodes. First, you would add your destination node to the list and give it a distance value of 0. Then on each iteration of the algorithm, you would take the first node, mark all of its unvisited neighbours with current nodes' distance values plus 1 and add them to the end of the list. After this, we will remove the first node from the list and repeat our operation with the new first node. We will keep doing this until there are no nodes left. The distance values produced by the grassfire algorithm indicate the smallest number of steps needed to move from each node to the goal. In the case where no path exists the procedure terminates before the start node is marked indicating that no path exists.

So according to the strategy he required coordinates are 
# (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6)
